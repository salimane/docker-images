# Salimane Docker Base Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles for the base images that all my Dockerized applications are based upon. The top base image can be pulled via: `docker pull salimane/cento7`

These images are automatically built and available on Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/salimane .
